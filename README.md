# Ames-housing-price-analysis
Explored 80 housing features using EDA and visualizations to uncover factors influencing sale price. Techniques used: Feature engineering, correlation analysis, heatmaps, regression plots, outlier handling.
##  Project Summary

This project analyzes 80+ variables related to residential homes, including property size, location, material quality, exterior features, and remodeling. Through feature engineering and visualization, we uncover what drives property value and provide insights useful for both sellers and real estate analysts.

##  Key Objectives

- Identify features most correlated with sale price
- Handle missing values and outliers in categorical and numerical columns
- Investigate how garage, basement, exterior, and remodeling features affect price
- Analyze the effect of neighborhoods and sale month on property values
- Compare price drivers between high-value and low-value neighborhoods

---

##  Techniques Used

- **Data Cleaning & Imputation**
- **Outlier Detection & Capping**
- **Feature Engineering** (e.g., basement finish score, remodel flag)
- **Visualizations**:
  - Box plots, heatmaps, scatter plots, bar charts
  - Feature vs SalePrice comparison by category
- **Grouped Aggregations & Correlation Analysis**

---

##  Key Insights

- **Gr Liv Area** and **Overall Quality** are the strongest continuous predictors of sale price.
- **Neighborhood**, **Garage Area**, and **Remodeling** significantly affect pricing.
- **Finished basements (GLQ/ALQ)** and **high-quality fencing (GdPrv)** positively impact value.
- **Poured concrete foundations** and **GasA heating systems** are linked with higher sale prices.
- **Houses sold in summer months (Juneâ€“August)** tend to have higher prices.

##  Next Steps (Future Work)

- Build a regression model (Linear, XGBoost) to predict SalePrice
- Add geospatial analysis using latitude/longitude
- Compare trends with external factors like mortgage rates, inflation
